# CodeClause_FAKE_NEWS_DETECTION

TASK 1 : FAKE NEWS DETECTION

From this project we can built a model to detect fake news.
## INTRODUCTION
This Project is to solve the problem with fake news. In this we have used two datasets named "Fake" and "True" from Kaggle. 

You can download the file from here https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset. 

I have used five classifiers in this project the are Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression.

## CLASSIFICATION MODELS

Classification models can be used to predict the dependent variable. Here we are going to use 5 different algorithms for classification namely, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression. Atlast we compare their accuracy to find the suitable classification technique for this problem. The given dataset is seperated into two seperate train and test sets. The train set is used to train the model, and the test set is used to predict the accuracy of each model. Finally, we compare the results. Here, 70% of the dataset was considered for training and 30% of the dataset for testing.

### ACCURACY OF EACH MODEL USING TEST DATA

|     Algorithm           | Accuracy  |
|------------------------:|-----------|
|   Naive Bayes           |   95.07   |
|   Decision Tree         |   99.62   |
|   Random Forest         |   99.18   |
|   Logistic Regression   |   99.02   |
|   SVM                   |   99.58   |

## RESULT
Comparing the scores and accuarcy of each model, it is seen the Decision Tree classification algorithm provides the highest accuracy for this problem using the Fake News Data Set. From the decision tree model we found that it predicts 99.63% accuracy

## CONCLUSION

The purpose of this project was to compare different classification algorithms to build a model to detect fake news. Find and compare the accuracy of each model to find the best classifier. 
Finally train the model using the complete dataset. The final_model computed here can be used to to detect fake news.
